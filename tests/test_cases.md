Within-request IP duplicates (same IP in two rules or twice in same rule)

Within-request 5-tuple duplicates (full rule duplicate)

Within-request partial (IP, proto, port, appid, url) overlap

Cross-policy 5-tuple duplicates (across request and existing)

Cross-policy partial (IP, proto, port, appid, url) overlap

Cases with both types at once (good!)
